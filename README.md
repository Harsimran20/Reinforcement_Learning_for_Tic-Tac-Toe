# TicTacToe Q-Learning Agent

## Project Description
This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game environment and a Q-Learning agent that learns to play the game through reinforcement learning. The agent gradually improves its strategy by exploring possible moves and updating its knowledge based on game outcomes. The project demonstrates core concepts of reinforcement learning applied to a classic board game.

## Features
- **Tic-Tac-Toe Environment:** Implements game logic, valid moves, and win/draw conditions.
- **Q-Learning Agent:** Uses a Q-table to learn the optimal action-value function.
- **Epsilon-Greedy Policy:** Balances exploration and exploitation during training.
- **Training & Testing:** Supports training over multiple episodes and testing performance against a random opponent.
- **Board Visualization:** Simple console-based board rendering for easier debugging and visualization.

## Technologies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
